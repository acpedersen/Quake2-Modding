This is a Mario Mod for quake 2.
In order to install the mod, simply open the folder "Mario Mod" and drag all of the files into the root directory of your quake2 install.
Reccommended to rename your Quake2.exe first so it does not get lost.
This should move a new folder into your root directory called "MarioMod".
Inside that there is a shortcut that may have to have it's target directory changed, it is set to the default steam install location by default, please change it if this is not the case.
