This is a Mario Mod for quake 2.
In order to install the mod, simply open the folder "Mario Mod" and drag all of the files into the root directory of your quake2 install.
Reccommended to rename your Quake2.exe first so it does not get lost.
This should move a new folder into your root directory called "MarioMod".
Inside that there is a shortcut that may have to have it's target directory changed, it is set to the default steam install location by default, please change it if this is not the case.


To test the mod, simply create a deathmatch network and see that you have an increasing height jump that resets if you are too slow. Jumping on any enemy will kill them. Their is a coin counter above ammo, the only way to add to it though is to use the cmd "give coin #" where # is how many coins to give, although if none is set the default is 5.

To test 3rd person camera, type in chasecam into the console to enable it. Chasecam was entirely from this tutorial https://www.quakewiki.net/archives/qdevels/quake2/29_6_98.html
